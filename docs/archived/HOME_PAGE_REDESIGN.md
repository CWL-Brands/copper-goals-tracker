# Home Page Redesign - Complete ✅

## Date: 2025-09-30

## Problem Statement
The original home page had poor UX flow:
- ❌ Team Overview at top (not personal)
- ❌ User info buried in middle
- ❌ Duplicate sync buttons (Team Overview + Quick Actions)
- ❌ Duplicate period selectors
- ❌ Quick Actions at bottom (hard to access)
- ❌ Calendar took too much space (30+ tiles)

## New Design Flow

### Visual Hierarchy (Top to Bottom):
```
1. User Header          → "Who am I?"
2. Quick Actions        → "What can I do?"
3. My Active Goals      → "How am I performing?"
4. My Weekly Activity   → "What did I do this week?"
5. Team Performance     → "How's the team doing?"
6. Goals Calendar       → "Monthly activity view"
```

## Changes Made

## UX Improvements

### Visual Flow
```
Personal Identity → Actions → Performance → Activity → Team → Calendar
```

### Information Architecture
1. **Context First** - Who am I? What period?
2. **Actions Second** - What can I do right now?
3. **Personal Third** - My goals and activity
4. **Team Fourth** - How's everyone doing?
5. **Detail Last** - Monthly calendar view

### Removed Redundancies
- ❌ Duplicate period selectors (was 2, now 1)
- ❌ Duplicate sync buttons (was 2, now 1)
- ❌ Duplicate "Set Goal" buttons (was 2, now 1)
- ❌ Redundant user info section (consolidated)

### Color Coding
- 🟢 **Green** - Primary actions (Set Goal)

- ⚫ **Gray** - Secondary actions
- 🟢 **Green borders** - Today indicator
